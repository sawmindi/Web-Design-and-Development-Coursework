                    It is presented very emerging as a tourist hot spot in the East of Sri Lanka. Coconut palms and palmyra trees adorn the shores of this area; due to the semi-arid state, Sunscreen and a 
                    large-brimmed hat are recommended along with lots of liquid to keep the heat under control.</p>
